## Hello There! I'm Michał Łęcicki (aka Maikhel) 👋

I'm a Ruby software engineer 💎 I believe self-improvement, responsibility, and clean solutions are necessary to get things done, both in software and real life. 🔨

### My Journey

My programming journey started in 2012 with.. nah.. this page is not my CV. If you want to know details about my career path, please head to my [personal page](https://maikhel.github.io/about) or [LinkedIn profile](www.linkedin.com/in/maikhel) 🪪 

## Blog posts
I like writing. 🖋️

It helps me gain deeper understanding of the topic and share it with others.
Usually, I cover Ruby and Rails related topics, feel free to check out my work on [Visuality blog](https://www.visuality.pl/posts?author=Micha%C5%82+%C5%81%C4%99cicki). Since I have more then 15 blog posts written, let me share only favourite ones here:

## Workshops

My recent achievement was leading the workshops with [@piowit](https://github.com/piowit) - Building live kanban board with Rails and Hotwire 🎉
We spent 3 hours teaching and building a live, dynamic, interactive kanban board with newest Hotwire Turbo. Awesome experience!


## Getting Things Done

I use GTD to manage my personal and work life from more than 10 years now! 
Check out the blog series I wrote on the topic:
- [My thoughts after using Getting Things Done for 10 years](https://maikhel.github.io/2022/10/18/gtd-thoughts-after-10-years.html)
- [GTD Setup I use](https://maikhel.github.io/2022/12/22/gtd-setup.html)
- [5 steps to get you started with GTD](https://maikhel.github.io/2023/01/30/gtd-starting-guide.html)

<details>
    <summary>I also strong believe in The Cult of Done Manifesto</summary>
  
    1. There are three states of being. Not knowing, action and completion.
    2. Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done.
    3. There is no editing stage.
    4. Pretending you know what you’re doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just accept that you know what you’re doing even if you don’t and do it.
    5. Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.
    6. The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.
    7. Once you’re done you can throw it away.
    8. Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps you from being done.
    9. People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right.
    10. Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.
    11. Destruction is a variant of done.
    12. If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of done.
    13. Done is the engine of more.

## After work
- Psychology still remains in my deep interest, mostly cognitive psychology and all productivity related staff. 🧠
- Playing board games is one of my favourites activities, ask me if you need recommendations! 🎲
- Hunting for the perfect photo scene 📸 - check out my photos [here](https://500px.com/p/mlecicki?view=photos)
- I'm in the elite group of people who read books 📚
- Long winter evenings = fireplace + watching snooker 🎱

Oh, and I’m a big Star Wars fan (mostly pre-Disney era movies.. 😢)
