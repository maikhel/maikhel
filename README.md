## Hello There! I'm Michał Łęcicki (aka Maikhel) 👋

I'm a Ruby software engineer 💎 \
I believe self-improvement, responsibility, and clean solutions are essential for getting things done, both in software and real life. 🔨

### My Journey

My programming journey started in 2012.. but this page isn't my CV.  If you want to know more about my career path, please visit my [personal page](https://maikhel.github.io/about) or [LinkedIn profile](www.linkedin.com/in/maikhel) 🪪 

## Blog posts
I like writing. 🖋️ \
It helps me gain a deeper understanding of topics and allows me to share knowledge with others. 
I usually cover Ruby and Rails-related subjects. Feel free to check out my work on the [Visuality blog](https://www.visuality.pl/posts?author=Micha%C5%82+%C5%81%C4%99cicki). \
With more then 15 blog posts written, here are some of my favorites:

## Workshops

One of my recent achievements was leading a workshop with [@piowit](https://github.com/piowit) titled "Building a Live Kanban Board with Rails and Hotwire". We spent 3 hours teaching and building a live, dynamic, interactive Kanban board using the latest Hotwire Turbo. It was an awesome experience! 🎉

## Getting Things Done

I use GTD to manage my personal and work life from more than 10 years now! 
Check out the blog series I wrote on the topic:
- [My thoughts after using Getting Things Done for 10 years](https://maikhel.github.io/2022/10/18/gtd-thoughts-after-10-years.html)
- [GTD Setup I use](https://maikhel.github.io/2022/12/22/gtd-setup.html)
- [5 steps to get you started with GTD](https://maikhel.github.io/2023/01/30/gtd-starting-guide.html)

<details>
    <summary>I also strong believe in The Cult of Done Manifesto</summary>
  
    1. There are three states of being. Not knowing, action and completion.
    2. Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done.
    3. There is no editing stage.
    4. Pretending you know what you’re doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just accept that you know what you’re doing even if you don’t and do it.
    5. Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.
    6. The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.
    7. Once you’re done you can throw it away.
    8. Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps you from being done.
    9. People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right.
    10. Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.
    11. Destruction is a variant of done.
    12. If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of done.
    13. Done is the engine of more.

## After work
- Psychology still remains in my deep interest, mostly cognitive psychology and all productivity related staff. 🧠
- Playing board games is one of my favourites activities, ask me if you need recommendations! 🎲
- I enjoy hunting.. Hunting for the perfect photo scene 📸. Check out my photos [here](https://500px.com/p/mlecicki?view=photos)
- I'm part of the elite group of people who love to read books 📚
- Long winter evenings = a fireplace  + watching snooker 🎱

Oh, and I’m a big Star Wars fan (mostly pre-Disney era movies.. 😢)
